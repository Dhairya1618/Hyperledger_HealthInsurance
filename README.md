# Hyperledger_HealthInsurance

This project implements a smart contract for a health insurance system using Hyperledger Fabric. The contract allows for creating health insurance policies, submitting claims, and managing sensitive medical data in a secure manner. It supports role-based access to sensitive information and ensures the integrity of the policy and claim data.
