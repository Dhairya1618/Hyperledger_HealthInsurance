# Health Insurance using Hyperledger Fabric

This project implements a smart contract for a health insurance system using Hyperledger Fabric. The contract allows for creating health insurance policies, submitting claims, and managing sensitive medical data in a secure manner. It supports role-based access to sensitive information and ensures the integrity of the policy and claim data.

Future Development:
- Implementation on a test network
- Enhanced security mechanisms and encryption
- Scalability and Optimisation
- User Interface
